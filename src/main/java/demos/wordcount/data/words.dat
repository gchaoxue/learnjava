The word count is the number of words in a document or passage of text.
Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words.
This may particularly be the case in academia, legal proceedings, journalism and advertising.
Word count is commonly used by translators to determine the price for the translation job.
Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of readability and to measure typing and reading speeds(usually in words per minute).
When converting character counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.
